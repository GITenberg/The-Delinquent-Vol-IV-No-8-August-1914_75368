<p>[This very illuminating book review of “Within Prison Walls,” a book by Thomas Mott Osborne, has, by
agreement, been published jointly in <i>The Delinquent</i> and The Survey. The editor of <i>The Delinquent</i>
had at first planned to give to several persons the pleasant task of reviewing Mr. Osborne’s important book.
But Dr. Hart has written so graphic a review that we shall be content with this. The second article in this
month’s magazine follows logically this review.]</p>
</div>

<p>In his book, “Within Prison Walls,”
“Tom Brown,” (Hon. Thomas Mott
Osborne) has given a remarkable study
of the mind of the convict. This book
should be read in connection with Donald
Lowrie’s book, “My Life In Prison,”
which portrays the prisoner from the
vantage point of actual and prolonged
experience but without the advantage
of Mr. Osborne’s wider knowledge of
human life and human philosophy.</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne’s study is an astonishing
achievement for a single week. To
break the crust of officialism and without
legal authority to command the co-operation
of unwilling prison officials; to
overcome the suspicions and the reticence
of the prisoners, to secure their
general co-operation in his plan, and to
gain admission to the inner circles of
convict life; and then to really put himself
in the place of a prisoner and to
realize how he feels, how he thinks and
to catch his viewpoint—to do all this in
a week was an astonishing piece of work.</p>

<p>Of course, his work was fragmentary
and incomplete, but the writer has known
prison officers who have associated with
prisoners for years without obtaining
such a knowledge of their mental processes
as Mr. Osborne gained in a week.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that Mr.
Julian Hawthorne did not seize the opportunity
of his experience at Atlanta
and apply his literary genius to record
and analyze the effects of prison life upon
himself and his associates. He might
have written a classic equal to De Quincey’s
“Confessions of an Opium Eater,”
but he choose instead to retell the gossip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
and scandals of the State prisons, true
and false, as given him by second and
third-term convicts.</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne, having been appointed
by Governor Sulzer as chairman of a
commission to recommend improvements
in the prison system of the State
of New York, resolved to become a voluntary
prisoner at Auburn and to put
himself, as nearly as possible, in the
place of the actual convict. He frankly
declared his purpose in the prison chapel,
asking the co-operation of the officers
and prisoners to make his experience as
realistic as possible; and they took him
at his word.</p>

<p>He entered the prison gates in citizen’s
clothes and was registered by the
receiving officer as “Thomas Brown,
33,333x.” He was conducted by an officer
to the tailor shop, where in a corner
of the shop without any screens and
in full view of all passers in and out,
are three porcelain lined iron bath tubs
side by side. He stripped, bathed and
dressed in the conventional prison suit
and was supplied with a “cake of soap,
one towel and a bible.” He was admonished
by the Principal Keeper (“P. K.”),
was given a copy of the prison rules and
was assigned to work in the basket shop.
During the first two days he was catechized
as to his past life, occupations, habits,
etc., by the principal keeper, the chaplain,
the doctor, and the clerk of the
Bertillon identification system, with
much repetition.</p>

<p>It had been agreed with the warden
that Tom Brown should be placed, at
first, with the “Idle Company,” a group
of prisoners who were characterized by
one of the officers as “the toughest bunch
of fellows in the prison.” He was disappointed
therefore when he found himself
in the basket shop where the men
were courteous, communicative and
helpful, and was astonished after two
days to discover that this was the identical
“worst bunch in the prison” of
which he had been told. Tom Brown
was assigned to a cell 4 by 7&#189; feet and
7&#189; feet high. (Many of the cells are
only 3&#189; feet wide). Many cells of this
kind contain two men each. The cell
contained a stool, a folding shelf, a folding
bed, a wash basin, a tin cup, a broom,
a small wooden locker, and an electric
bulb.</p>

<p>Tom Brown swung open his cell door
at a signal, marched in line, carried out
and emptied his own cell bucket, ate
prison fare in the prison dining-room
(including prison hash), did his stint in
the basket shop with refractory material
which made his fingers sore, and served
on a detail moving railroad cars with
block and tackle. He received from his
fellow prisoners donations of sugar, of
doubtful origin, for his oatmeal. He
received communications and newspapers
from numerous sources by underground
communication. He learned to
talk without moving his lips and he
found himself instinctively joining with
his associates “agin the government.”
He details most interestingly the petty
items that make up the life of the prisoner
and revealed how much unhappiness
may be caused by things which appear
insignificant in themselves, such as
the collapsing of the folding cot, under
inexperienced hands, after the extinguishment
of the lights.</p>

<p>Tom Brown reveals startlingly the
horrors of prison life to the man of refined
sensibilities—the shock of the first
night of cell life when the lights went
out.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The bars are so black that they seem to
close in upon you,—to come nearer and
nearer, until they press upon your forehead....
You can feel the blackness of those iron bars
across your closed eyelids; they seem to sear
themselves into your very soul. It is the most
terrible sensation I ever experienced. I understand
now the prison pallor; I understand
the sensitiveness of this prison audience; I
understand the high nervous tension which
makes anything possible. How does any man
remain sane, I wonder, caged in this stone
grave, day after day, night after night?”</p>
</div>

<p>He tells the ghastly story of the collapse
of a poor old prisoner in a shop:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In due time a litter is brought; the pitiful
fragment of humanity is placed gently upon
it and is carried out of the shop into which
he will probably never return. The look on
his face was one not easy to forget in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
white stare of patient suffering. It seemed to
typify long years of stolid endurance until the
worn-out old frame had simply crumpled under
the accumulated load.”</p>
</div>

<p>He experienced the humiliation of being
the object of pursuit by pertinacious
curiosity-hunters and camera-fiends; yet
the change in his appearance was so
great that he escaped recognition by
personal friends who were watching
carefully for him. The crowning horror
he describes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cell house has settled down for the
night. Only a few muffled sounds make the
stillness more distinctly felt. Then, suddenly,
the unearthly quiet is shattered by a terrifying
uproar. It is too far away to hear at first
anything with distinctness; it is all a confused
and hideous mass of shouting—a shouting
first of a few, then of more, then of many
voices. I have never heard anything more
dreadful—in the full meaning of the word—full
of dread. My heart is thumping like a
trip hammer and the cold shivers run up and
down my back.</p>

<p>“I jump to the door of the cell, pressing my
ear close to the cold iron bars. Then I can
distinguish a few words sounding against the
background of the confused outcry: ‘Stop
that!’ ‘Leave them alone!’ ‘Damn you, stop
that!’ Then some dull thuds; I even fancy
that I hear something like a groan, along
with the continued confused and violent
shouting. What can it be!</p>

<p>“While I am perfectly aware that I am not
in the least likely to be harmed, I am shivering
close akin to a chill of actual terror. If
anyone near at hand were to give vent to a
sudden yell I feel that I might easily lose my
self control and shout and bang my door with
the rest of them.</p>

<p>“The cries continue, accompanied with
other noises that I cannot make out. Then
my attention is attracted by whispering at
one of the lower windows.... It is so dark
outside that I can see nothing, not even the
dim shapes of the whisperers....</p>

<p>“The shouts die down. There are a few
more vague and uncertain sounds—all the
more dreadful for being uncertain; somewhere
an iron door clangs! Then stillness
follows, like that of the grave.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tom Brown reported this mysterious
occurrence to the warden who promised
to investigate. Next day the warden
“has inquired into it, he says, and found
it was only a case of a troublesome fellow
sent up from Sing Sing, who was
making some little disturbance in the
gallery. After they had admonished him
he wouldn’t stop, so they had to take
him down to the jail. When the officer
entered his cell, he threw his bucket at
the officer and there was a little row.
‘I’m inclined to think,’ adds the warden,
‘that he may be a little bit crazy, and I’m
ed further investigation, telling the warden
that, from information which has
come to him, he thinks that the officers
are “trying to slip one over” on him.’</p>

<p>From his fellow prisoners Tom Brown
obtained what he believes to be the correct
version of the incident, as follows:
“There had lately been sent up from Sing
Sing a young prisoner ... pale, thin
and undersized; weight about 120
pounds; age 21.” On charge of impertinence
to an officer he had been kept in
a dark punishment cell five days, on
bread and water. (The allowance of
water was 3 gills per day). He was
sent back to work but was unfit and
next day remained in his cell ill, but “in
spite of his repeated requests, the doctor
was not summoned. The reason probably
was that he was in the state known
in prison as bughouse—that is to say at
least flighty, if not temporarily out of
his mind”.... “In the evening, he
created some disturbance by calling out
remarks which violated the quiet of the
cell-block.” “I understand,” Tom Brown
says, “something of this sort: ‘If you
want to kill me, why don’t you do it at
once and not torture me to death?’ He
seemed to be possessed with the idea that
his life was in danger.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now here was a young man, hardly more
than a lad, in a sick and nervous condition
that had produced temporary derangement of
mind. What course did the system take in
dealing with that suffering being! Two keepers
opened his cell, made a rush for him and
knocked him down.... During the brief
scuffle in the cell the iron pail and the bucket
were overturned. Then, after being handcuffed,
the unresisting if not unconscious
youth was flung out of his cell with such violence
that, if it had not been for a convict
trusty who stood by, he would have slipped
under the rail of the gallery and fallen to the
stone floor of the corridor four stories below,
and been either killed or crippled for life.</p>

<p>“Then the two keepers, being reinforced by
a third, dragged their victim roughly down
stairs, partly on his back, kicked and beat him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
on the way, and carried him before the Principal
Keeper, who promptly sent him down to
the jail again.” (i.e., the punishment cells).</p>

<p>“This scene of violence could not pass unnoticed;
and the loud protests and outcries of
the prisoners whose cells were near by, ...
were the sounds I heard far away in my cell.”
A trusty who saw most of the occurrence “so
far forget his position as to venture the opinion
that it was ‘a pretty raw deal’. This remark
was overheard by an officer; and the
trusty at once received the warning that he
had better keep his mouth shut and not talk
about what didn’t concern him.</p>

<p>“If it is realized that these officers have
what almost amounts to the power of life and
death over the convicts it can be understood
that such a warning was not one to be lightly
disregarded.”</p>
</div>

<p>After three days further detention in
the “jail” the prisoner was transferred
to the hospital, where he received proper
care, but “he had at first no clear
recollection of the brutal treatment of
which he had been the victim.”</p>

<p>An interesting side light is thrown
upon the official side of prison life by an
episode connected with this case of punishment.
Immediately after the episode,
Tom Brown questioned one of the officers
who refused to answer the questions.
On the following morning the
same officer came to Tom Brown, who
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This morning he is exceedingly bland....
He enters upon a long rigmarole, the gist of
which is how necessary it is for a man to do
his duty.... Then he casually turns the
conversation around to show how closely connected
he is to various admirers of my father
and myself, and gracefully insinuates that he
also shares these feelings.... It is borne
in upon me that he not only knows all about
last night’s disturbance, but that he was probably
concerned in it, and is now deliberately
trying to switch me off the track.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another side light upon the official
side of prison life is that Tom Brown
discovered that prisoners under punishment
were never released from the jail
on Sunday. When he made an appeal
to the Principal Keeper to transfer the
sick boy from the dark cell to the hospital,
the Principal Keeper objected strenuously,
but when the prison physician
joined in the appeal, “finally the P. K.
with an air of triumph brings out his
last and conclusive argument. ‘There
is a great deal in what you say, gentlemen,
and I should like to oblige you, Mr.
Osborne, but you see this is Sunday; and
you know we never let ’em out of jail on
Sunday.’ ... ‘Sunday!’ I exclaimed.
‘In Heaven’s name, P. K., what is Sunday?
Isn’t it the Lord’s Day? Very
well, then. Do you mean to tell me you
actually think if you take a poor sick
boy, with an open wound in his ear, out
of a close, dirty, vermin-filled, dark cell,
where he isn’t allowed to wash, and has
but three gills of water a day ... and
put him back into the hospital, where the
Doctor says he belongs—do you really
think that such an act of mercy would be
displeasing to God?’ ‘Why,’ he gasps,
‘that’s true. I think you’re right. We
put ’em in on Sunday; why shouldn’t we
take ’em out?’”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne certified that this story
is fully corroborated by careful inquiry
from different men and comments as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Doubtless some will say that the statements
of convicts are not to be believed. That
touches upon one of the very worst features
of the situation. No discrimination is ever
made. It is not admitted, that while one convict
may be a liar, another may be entirely
truthful; that men differ in prison exactly as
in the world outside. It is held, quite as a
matter of course, that they are all liars, and an
officer’s word will be taken against that of a
convict or any number of convicts. The result
is that the officers feel themselves practically
immune from any evil consequences to
them from their own acts of injustice or violence.
What follows this is inevitable. Our
prisons have often been the scenes of intolerable
brutality, for which it has been useless
for the victims to seek redress. They can
only cower and endure in silence; or be driven
into insanity by a hopeless revolt against the
System....</p>

<p>“The point is this: that no convict has any
rights—not even the right to be believed; not
even the right to reasonable considerate
treatment. He is exposed without safeguard
of any sort to whatever outrage and inconsiderate
and brutal keeper may choose to inflict
upon him; and you cannot under the present
system guard against such inconsiderate and
brutal treatment.</p>

<p>“I should not like to be understood as asserting
that all keepers are brutal or even a
majority of them.” ... But, “we must recognize,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
in dealing with our Prison System,
that many really well-meaning men will operate
a system, in which the brutality of an officer
goes unpunished, in a brutal manner.</p>

<p>“The reason of this is not far to seek—a
reason which also obtained in the slave system.
The most common and powerful impulse
that drives an ordinary, well-meaning
man to brutality is fear.... In prison,
where each officer believes that his life is in
constant danger, the keeper tends to become
callous; the sense of that danger blunts his
higher qualities.... Undoubtedly there is
basis for his fear, for some of those men are
dangerous, rendered more so by the nerve-racking
System. I can conceive no more terribly
disintegrating moral experience than
that of being a keeper over convicts.</p>

<p>“I am not now in any way disputing the
necessity of a keeper being constantly on his
guard; I am not saying whether this view of
things is right or wrong; and when I use the
word fear I do not mean cowardice—a very different
thing, for a brave man can feel fear.
I am simply trying to point out that in prison,
as elsewhere, when men are dominated by fear,
brutality is the evitable result.”</p>
</div>

<p>In view of this episode, Tom Brown
determined to undergo the horrors of
the “Jail.” To this the prison warden
very reluctantly consented. It was
agreed that he should be treated exactly
like a convict under punishment except
that a “jail suit” should be cleansed for
his use, whereas the ordinary prisoners
use them interchangeably, without cleaning.
Accordingly, Tom Brown suddenly
knocked off work, declaring that the material
furnished was unfit and he wasn’t
going to work any more anyhow. His
shop captain, finding him obdurate, had
no option and was obliged to send him
to the Principal Keeper who, finding him
still obdurate, reluctantly ordered him
to the “jail,” which Tom Brown describes
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A vaulted stone dungeon, about 50 by 20
feet, having on one side the death chamber
for electrocuting murderers, and on the other
side the prison dynamo with its ceaseless
grinding, night and day. It is absolutely bare,
except for one wooden bench along the north
end, a locker where the jail clothes are kept,
and eight cells, of solid sheet iron; floor,
sides, back and roof. They are studded with
rivets, projecting about a quarter of an inch.
At the time that Warden Rattigan came into
office there was no other floor; the inmates
slept on the bare iron and the rivets! The
cells are about 4&#189; by 8 feet and 9 feet high.
There is a feeble attempt at ventilation—a
small hole in the roof of the cell, which does
not ventilate. Practically there is no air in
the cell except what percolates in through
the extra heavily grated door.” Two windows
in the vaulted room outside admit some
light but, except on a bright sunny day, an
electric light is necessary in order to see the
inside of the cell. “Up to the time of Supt.
Riley’s and Warden Rattigan’s coming into
office the supply of water for each prisoner
was limited to one gill for 24 hours.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a sink in the outer room but
“the sink was not used for the prisoners
to wash for the simple reason that the
prisoners in the jail were not allowed to
wash.”</p>

<p>On entrance, Tom Brown was instructed
to take off his clothes and put on the
jail suit which had been cleansed in anticipation
of his coming. He says: “If
these are the clothes which have been
carefully washed and cleaned for me, I
should like to examine—at a safe distance—the
ordinary ones. They must
be filthy beyond words.” He was carefully
searched by the captain to discover
whether he had any weapon or instrument
upon his person. His handkerchief
was taken from him, presumably
to avoid danger of suicide, because a
prisoner once strangled himself with his
handkerchief. He was given a small tin
water can.</p>

<p>The cell contained no seat, bed, mattress
or bedding—nothing except a papier-mache
bucket. A convict trusty
handed in through a slot in the door a
slice of bread and inserted the spout of
a tin funnel through which he poured
into the prisoner’s can exactly a gill of
water to last through the night. The
officers and the trusty departed and very
soon five other prisoners in adjacent cells
made themselves known. Then followed
an animated discussion on prison fare;
ethics of the jail; comparative merits of
transatlantic liners, politics, prison reform,
etc. Tom Brown says: “On the
whole, more intelligent, instructive and
entertaining conversation it has seldom
been my lot to enjoy.” To his surprise
he finds that these men, presumably the
worst in the prison, are human and even
sympathetic. One has been sent down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 5]</span>
“because he had talked back to one of
the citizen instructors;” two others for
a little scrap which involved no special
bitterness; a fourth for hitting a convict
with a crow bar because he had called
him a bad name; the fifth was a sick boy
whose ear was still discharging after an
operation. He had been sent down for
making trouble in the hospital and was
not allowed a handkerchief to take care
of the discharge from his ear. All prisoners
punished, whatever the character
of the offense, received the same treatment
and in addition to confinement on
bread and water were fined 50 cents for
each day of confinement; the fine to be
worked out at the rate of 1&#189; cents per
day, allowed each prisoner as “earnings.”
The prisoner also has to wear a mark
upon his sleeve from that day forward
indicating that he has been punished and,
if he has previously earned a good-conduct
bar by a year’s perfect record, that
bar is taken from him and, finally, some
portion, if not all, of the commutation
time which he may have gained by previous
good conduct is forfeited. Manifestly
a prison punishment is a serious
matter to the convict.</p>

<p>After four hours confinement Tom
Brown was visited by two prison officers,
it having been understood that he
would not stay longer, but to their astonishment
he refused to go, having determined
to experience the full limit of
jail life. They left him very reluctantly.
As the night wore on he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now that all chance of escape is gone I
begin to feel more than before the pressure
of the horror of this place; the close confinement;
the bad air; the terrible darkness, the
bodily discomforts, the uncleanness, the lack
of water. My throat is parched, but I dare
not drink more than a sip at a time, for my
one gill—what is left of it—must last until
morning. And then there is the constant
whir-whir-whirring of the dynamo next door
and the death chamber at our backs.”</p>
</div>

<p>The prisoners seek to mitigate their
misery. One asks: “Say fellows! what
would you say now to a nice thick juicy
steak with fried potatoes?” One “sings
an excellent ragtime ditty;” another “follows
with the Toreador’s song from Carmen,
sung in a sweet, true, light tenor
voice that shows real love and appreciation
of music.</p>

<p>“This is the place where I had expected
to meet the violent and dangerous
criminals; but what do I find! A genial
young Irishman, as pleasant company as
I have ever encountered, and a sweet
voiced boy singing Carmen.”</p>

<p>These entertainments over, the night
drags on. The wooden floor proves a
hard bed until a prisoner instructs him
how to make a pillow of his felt shoes
and his shirt. Bed bugs infest the place
and after killing one, he imagines multitudes.
The sick prisoner accidentally
upsets his water can and soon becomes
delirious, seeming likely to become a
raving maniac. There is no way to summon
an officer, but one of the prisoners
with amazing tact and patience soothes
his agitation until he finally falls asleep.</p>

<p>At last Brown falls into a doze but is
speedily awakened by a patrolling officer
who awakens the prisoners at 12:30
and 4:30 A. M. but refuses his request
to renew the water spilled by the sick
prisoner because it is “’gainst the rules.”</p>

<p>At 6 A. M. on Sunday, Tom Brown is
released from his punishment, convinced
that the “System” is illogical, antiquated,
barbarous, cruel and destructive to
the character of prisoners and officers
alike. He is exhausted, body and soul;
but he finds strength to make a chapel
address to the prisoners, which must
have been memorable. The prisoners
are tremendously impressed by the fact
that this man of education, culture and
wealth has voluntarily endured for six
days the same treatment as themselves,
in the endeavor to understand their situation
and, if possible, to improve it; they
recognize that the cell, the march, the
shock and the dungeon affect the man of
culture and refinement more keenly than
the ordinary prisoner; but the thing
which affects them most profoundly is
the vicarious character of his act. They
would almost apply to it the words of
the prophet Isaiah: “Surely he hath
borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Osborne is not content to discover
and reveal the vices of the prison
system but he seeks a practical remedy.
To this end he has taken counsel, not
only with the prison authorities and students
of penological science, but also
with the prisoners who live under the
system and, some of whom, are keenly
alive to its destructive influence. A
prisoner in the shops gave him the basic
idea. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For some years I have felt that the principles
of self-government might possibly be the
key to the solution of the prison problem; but
as yet I have not been able to see clearly how
to begin its application. There have seemed
to be almost insuperable difficulties. In this
connection Jack” (Jack Murphy, a prisoner)
“made a suggestion which supplies a most important
link in the chain.</p>

<p>“In discussing the various aspects of prison
life we reached the subject of the long and
dreary Sundays. Jack agrees with all those
with whom I have talked that the long stretch
in the cells, from the conclusion of the chapel
service, between ten-thirty and eleven o’clock
Sunday morning until seven Monday morning—over
twenty hours, is a fearful strain both
physical and mental upon the prisoners.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Jack,’ I say, ‘from what I have heard
Superintendent Riley say, I feel sure he would
like to give the men some sort of exercise or
recreation on Sunday afternoons; but how
could it be managed! You can’t ask the officers
to give up their day off, and you don’t
think the men could be trusted by themselves,
do you!’</p>

<p>“‘Why not?’ says Jack.</p>

<p>“I look at him enquiringly.</p>

<p>“‘Why, look here, Tom. I know this place
through and through. I know these men;
I’ve studied ’em for years. And I tell you that
the big majority of these fellows in here will
be square with you if you give ’em a chance.
The trouble is they don’t treat us on the level.
I could tell you all sorts of frame-ups they
give us. Now if you trust a man, he will try
and do what’s right; sure he will. That is,
most men will. Of course, there are a few
that won’t. There are some dirty curs—degenerates—that
will make trouble, but there
ain’t so very many of those. Look at that
road work! Haven’t the men done fine!
How many prisoners have you out on the
roads! About 130; and you ain’t had a single
runaway yet. And if there should be any
runaways you can just bet we’d show ’em
what we think about it.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you really think, Jack, that the Superintendent
and the Warden could trust you
fellows out in the yard on Sunday afternoons
in summer!’</p>

<p>“‘Sure they could,’ responds Jack....
‘And there could be a band concert.... And
it would be a good sight better for us than
being locked in our cells all day. You’d have
fewer fights on Monday, I know that.’</p>

<p>“‘But how about the discipline! Would you
let everybody out in the yard! What about
those bad actors who don’t know how to behave!
Won’t they quarrel and fight and try
to escape?’</p>

<p>“‘But don’t you see, Tom, that they couldn’t
do that without putting the whole thing on
the bum, and depriving the rest of us of our
privileges? You needn’t be afraid we couldn’t
handle those fellows all right! Or why not
let out only those men who have a good conduct
bar! That’s it!’ He continues, enthusiastically
warming up to the subject, ‘That’s
it, Tom, a good conduct league, and give the
privilege of Sunday afternoons to the members
of the league.’”</p>
</div>

<p>This suggestion of Jack Murphy bore
practical fruit. Soon after his “discharge,”
Mr. Osborne, with the co-operation
of the Superintendent of Prisons
and the Warden of Auburn Prison, succeeded
in establishing a Good Conduct
League composed of prisoners, with
officers elected by their fellow prisoners.
The prisoners are given the liberty of
the yard on Sunday afternoons, with a
greatly reduced force of guards. They
march to and from their cells and their
work under the direction of prisoners.
They prepare entertainments with the
permission and approval of their officers.
This plan has now been in operation for
several months without the slightest disorder
or accident and with marked improvement
in the spirit and behaviour of
the men.</p>

<p>This inspiring demonstration represents
no new discovery by Jack Murphy
or by Mr. Osborne. It is only a re-discovery
of what was practiced by Captain
Alexander Machonochie at Norfolk
Island with transported British convicts
seventy years ago. The writer saw Colonel
Gardner Tufts doing similar things
with convicts at Concord, Massachusetts,
nearly thirty years ago, where
prisoners were carrying on evening literary
societies in perfect order without
the presence of an officer. He saw similar
things done by Captain Hickox at the
Michigan State Prison more than twenty
years ago, where the old chaplain gathered
200 men in a single room for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
evening assembly with no officer present
but himself. This same principal is being
worked out in the State prisons of
Oregon and Colorado, in the Ohio State
Reformatory at Mansfield and in Doctor
Gilmour’s splendid work at Guelph,
Ontario. In all of these places it has
been found that when you build a wall
around a man he immediately wants to
climb over it and that when you turn
him loose and say, “I trust you and I
know that you will not betray me,” there
is almost always an instant response.</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne believes that this is the
first instance of the application of the
democratic principle to the management
of convicts in a large convict prison, and
that the Auburn experiment differs from
others in that the prisoners there themselves
originated the movement. He
says that “the good conduct of the prisoners
is in reality an outward expression
of an outward spiritual impulse.” “Hence
the name, ‘Mutual Welfare League,’;
hence the motto, ‘Do good, make good.’
By doing good to others the man makes
good for himself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne’s demonstrations make
it clear that those who believe that severity
is an essential part of prison methods
need not worry. Every convict is
punished. When you pillory a man before
the world as a criminal, transport
him by public conveyance and march
him through the streets in irons, put him
behind prison walls, deprive him of his
liberty, subject him absolutely to the will
of another man who holds practically
the powers of life and death, lock him
in an ill-ventilated prison cell, 4&#189; by 7
feet (perhaps with an uncongenial cell
mate), dress him in prison garb, exhibit
him to curious visitors at 25 cents per
head, subject him to strict compliance
with thirty to fifty exacting rules on
pain of loss of privileges and increase
of term, restrict his correspondence to
two censored letters per month, permit
him to see his wife and children only in
the presence of an officer and clad in
prison garb—under these circumstances
no one need question that the prisoner is
punished, even though he may have the
privilege of listening to a band concert
and watching a baseball game once a
week, conversing with his fellow convicts
in subdued tones at meals and witnessing
a moving picture show once or
twice a month. Let it never be forgotten
that the convict is punished!</p>

<p>Those who ridicule or condemn Mr.
Osborne’s adventure make a mistake.
It may have been sensational, but there
was need of a sensation. His experiment
was valuable because it was sincere
and because it has brought out the
truth. But it has brought out only part
of the truth.</p>

<p>We wish that Mr. Osborne would secure
an opportunity to be installed as
prison guard in some one of the great
prisons of the United States like the
Illinois State Penitentiary, the Indiana
State Prison of Michigan City, or
the Penitentiary at Pittsburgh, Pa. Let
him go incog., unknown to anyone except
the prison warden, and let him come
into the same intimate familiarity with
the life and thinking of the prison guard
as that which he has acquired in the case
of the prison convict. He has already
discovered the demoralizing tendency
of life of the prison guard, and has discovered
its chief flaw, namely, the ruling
principle of fear, to which must be
added the lack of psychological understanding
of the prisoner and the entire
lack of any adequate preliminary training.
There must be taken into account
also the fact that there exists among
prison guards, in an exaggerated degree,
the sentiment that it is dishonorable to
“snitch” upon a fellow officer and, while
a superior officer is likely to report a
subordinate for cruelty or misconduct,
the exposure of such actions by a guard
of equal rank is very unusual. The difficulty
can only be overcome by improving
the personnel and raising the moral
standards of prison guards. The day is
not far distant when training schools
for prison guards will hold the same relation
to prison work which training
schools for nurses hold to well-conducted
hospitals.</p>

<p>We wish that Mr. Osborne, or someone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
equally discerning, might put himself
in the place of the convict all the
way through and tell an equally convincing
story. Let him go forth with a five-dollar
discharge suit on his back so marked
as to betray to every passing policeman
the shop where it was made. Let
him go out with five dollars or possibly
ten dollars in his pocket to satisfy a sharpened
appetite and find a job in these
hard times. Let him meet the watchful
policeman, or the plain clothes man, who
advises him that “We’re on to you.”
Let him meet the discharged convict
who solicits the loan of a dollar with
implied threat of exposure. Let him take
a job in good faith and render faithful
service, only to be discharged at the end
of the second week because somebody
has given him away.</p>

<p>Let him be arrested, guilty or not
guilty, as a suspect of some crime. Let
him be subjected to the inquisition of
“the third degree,” regardless of the
rights which are supposed to be guaranteed
to every citizen that he shall be
deemed to be innocent until proven to be
guilty. Let him experience the starvation,
buffeting insults and detectives’ lies
which are incident to this inquisition.</p>

<p>Then, by all means, let Mr. Osborne’s
representative await trial in a county
jail and discover the beauties of a System
which is twice as vicious as the Auburn
Prison System which he describes.
Thrust him into a steel cage and exhibit
him to all comers like a wild beast in a
menagerie. Let him share his cell with
five other prisoners in a place where he
cannot keep himself free from vermin,
where he cannot take a bath, and force
him into intimate association, day and
night, with a mob of prisoners who are
kept in idleness, with no occupation except
to corrupt one another and to concoct
plans to escape by bribing or mobbing
the jailer or by cutting out of jail.</p>

<p>Let him stand trial in a court whose
judge is overwhelmed with business or
is fixed in the tradition that severity is
the only remedy for crime, with a prosecuting
attorney whose reputation depends
upon making as many convictions
as possible. Let him have assigned to
his defense an attorney who, because of
inexperience, incompetency, or indifference,
cannot present his case properly,
in order that his innocence may be demonstrated,
if he is innocent, or any
mitigating facts may be made clear if he
is guilty.</p>

<p>Or let Mr. Osborne’s representative
essay the role of a paroled prisoner, going
out as a ward of the State under the
direction of a parole officer, in order that
he may discover the efficiency and equity
of the Parole Board, the fidelity and
good-will of the parole officer, the patience
and fair dealing of the employer,
and the advantages and disadvantages
generally of the parole system.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to call the attention
of the public to the deficiencies of the
convict prisons, and the public ought to
know that Sing Sing is, and has been for
many years, far worse than Auburn.
Think of a prison where rheumatism and
tuberculosis form an inevitable part of
the prison sentence for a large proportion
of the prisoners, whose number can
be definitely predicted! But the prison
problem of the State of New York can
only be solved by a thoroughly organized
and persistent attack under the leadership
of men and women who have
social and economic vision.</p>

<p>And the prison problem of the State
of New York will not be solved until it
is recognized as a technical problem, demanding
the services of tried and expert
men. Prisons, like other educational institutions,
should be headed by superintendents
of demonstrated training and
efficiency, selected without reference to
geographical lines.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NEW_FREEDOM_AT_AUBURN_PRISON">THE NEW FREEDOM AT AUBURN PRISON</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub"><span class="smcap">By O. F. Lewis</span>,
<br>General Secretary, Prison Association of New York.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This article has been reprinted from The Outlook, by special permission of that periodical. The editor of
<i>The Delinquent</i> begs to say, that although he himself is the author of this article, he believes the new
development of self-government at Auburn, as described in the following article, is of sufficient importance to
warrant being called earnestly to the attention of our readers.]</p>
</div>

<p>The afternoon of the Fourth of July
was drawing to a close in the long building-inclosed
yard of Auburn Prison, in
the State of New York. Fourteen hundred
gray-suited inmates were playing a
score of different games. The afternoon’s
track events had come to an
end. The South Wing, with between
four and five hundred prisoners, had won
from the North Wing, with some nine
hundred prisoners, in the varied contests.
A silver cup, given by the president
of a prominent mortgage company
in New York, was the tangible goal of
the exciting battle.</p>

<p>Suddenly the clear bugle notes of the
“Retreat” sounded far down the yard,
slowly and melodiously. Instantly the
boys in gray began to fall into line at
their appointed places. There was now
silence where a moment before there
had been bowling, baseball, running,
dancing, piano, band, and the shouts of
swarming inmates. Then came the first
bars of the “Star-Spangled Banner,”
played by the prison inmate band. Off
came the caps, and down across the
breast. The flag sank slowly, lowered
from the tall pole by three inmates. The
music ceased, the caps were again donned,
and from the extreme end of the
yard rose suddenly a cheer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rah! Rah! Rah!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rah! Rah! Rah!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">South Wing! South Wing!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rah! Rah! Rah!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, preceded by the band and with
banners flying, the victorious athletes of
the South Wing marched up the center
walk between the files of other prisoners,
to receive the silver cup from the hands
of the donor, Mr. Richard M. Hurd.</p>

<p>I wish I had the power to make the
readers of The Outlook sense in full
the enormous significance for both present
and future of this recent Fourth of
July in Auburn Prison. You have read
in these recent months so often of the
greatly increased liberties granted to
prisoners that mere games or the unchecked
intercourse of prisoners on holidays
seems no epoch-making novelty.</p>

<p>But history was made at Auburn Prison
on Independence Day. For the
fourteen hundred men not only ran off
their own sports during the afternoon,
but they practically ran themselves,
through their appointed “delegates,”
chosen from among their own numbers
by their own votes. And assuredly no
more orderly group could have been
found on that Fourth of July anywhere
between the Atlantic and the Pacific.</p>

<p>A year ago Auburn Prison was austere
indeed. The holidays and the Sundays
were grievously dreaded by the inmates—dreaded
as they had been for
generations, because a Sunday or a holiday
meant that the inmates had been
locked into their miserable little cells at
about five o’clock on the previous day,
and that, except for a few brief hours
for chapel or for an entertainment on
holidays, they were locked in all through
the holiday until the next morning, when
work recommenced. Thirty-six hours,
more or less, in a wretched little cell,
hardly large enough to turn around in,
with no modern conveniences of toilet
or wash-basins—simply a hole in the solid
masonry wall of a building ninety-eight
years old, built at a time when prison
meant physical torture and oblivion,
and when prison architecture aided to
the maximum that purpose.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that a prisoner recently
said to me, on a Sunday afternoon
at Clinton Prison in New York State,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
where they still lock up their prisoners
from Saturday until Monday, with the
exceptions noted: “My God! It’s a
wonder we don’t all go insane in here!”
Is it any wonder that at Auburn Prison,
according to the words of one of the
leading prisoners, the inmates used to
consider themselves supremely lucky if
by some means they could get “dope” on
Saturday, with which to “put a shot into
themselves” on Sunday morning? Then
they would lie befuddled and bevisioned
during Sunday—the Lord’s Day! “And
on Monday morning,” laconically said
the prisoner, “we used to have the biggest
number of fights in the shops of
any day in the week. The effects of the
drug were wearing off, you know.”</p>

<p>This summer the difference is enormous
and fundamental. For an hour or
a little more on each week-day, and for
four full hours on Sunday, the prisoners
are turned out to recreation according to
their bent. And coincidentally with this
all-important change in the prison’s policy
toward the inmates has come an all-important
reduction in the number of
prison guards needed to supervise the
prisoners at their play. On the morning
of the Fourth, for instance, an entertainment
was given in the auditorium by
a local theatrical company. Practically
all the inmates—fourteen hundred—were
present. Many of the guards sat
in one little corner of the room, in the
extreme rear. They had been invited
by the Mutual Welfare League, the prisoners’
organization, to attend if they desired!</p>

<p>In the afternoon there were four
keepers in all in the yard, so I was informed.
They were thoroughly inconspicuous.
The “P. K.” (which is short for
Principal Keeper) started the afternoon
in uniform, but shortly changed to street
clothes. “You’ll find him playing ball
with the boys later today,” said one inmate
to me. All the guarding at the
several exits of the yard was done—apart
from the few guards—by the “delegates”
of the Mutual Welfare League.</p>

<p>The Mutual Welfare League! To
many prison officials, long in the service,
the name undoubtedly has a very sentimental
sound. I frankly confess that
several of us in the little party invited
by Mr. Thomas Mott Osborne to attend
the League’s celebration of the Fourth
of July were skeptical. We were afraid
it might prove to be amateurish and
mushy, even though we knew of the signal
value of Mr. Osborne’s self-imposed
incarceration at Auburn Prison last fall,
as shown by the Nation-wide attention
given to his subsequent story of the fearful
and unnecessary monotony and desperation
of prison life. But, as one of
our party said on Sunday morning, after
we had sat for several hours with the
Executive Committee of the League: “I
didn’t exactly come to scoff and remain
to pray; but I did come with doubt, and
I go away converted.”</p>

<p>What is it, then, about this new freedom
at Auburn Prison that has not only
converted a cautious, conservative president
of a board of reformatory managers
in another State, but has led him
within a week from his experience at
Auburn to urge successfully the introduction
of a similar league in his own
institution? Two facts, principally, I
think. In the first place, the Mutual
Welfare League plan works. Secondly,
there is a convincing air of sincerity, and
even devotion, about it all.</p>

<p>May I repeat what seems to me the
all-important fact about this development
at Auburn? The prisoners, in their
hours of recreation, in their attendance
at chapel, in their attendance at Sunday
afternoon concerts or entertainments,
<i>run themselves in large measure</i>. They
have not only given their promise to be
good, but they have chosen their own inmate
officers to see that they keep their
promise. There is all the difference in
the world between being run by a group
of prison guards, even under the best of
benevolent prison despotisms, and being
run by prisoner guards of one’s own
election.</p>

<p>If, then, the most sacred prerogative
of the traditional prison official can thus
be usurped by the prisoners themselves,
and if, in their own expressive language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
they can “get away with it,” in the sense
of securing better order, more work in
the shops, a marked reduction in the
number of offences committed or reported,
and a radical betterment in the always
limited joy of life in a penal institution,
what is the inference?</p>

<p>The organization and development of
the Mutual Welfare League were simple
enough. Last fall, when Mr. Osborne,
as chairman of a prison reform commission
that had been appointed by the Governor,
sent himself to prison for a week,
aided thereto by a friendly warden, he
informed the prisoners at a previous
chapel service that he was coming into
prison to try to understand the prison
life from the standpoint of the prisoner.
He asked the inmates to regard him,
“Tom Brown,” not as a stool-pigeon,
nor as simply a foolish amateur, but as
thoroughly in earnest in his desire to
better prison conditions by experiencing
them, even if only briefly and partially
for a week.</p>

<p>That was point Number One in the development
of what has happened at Auburn.
Those who make light of Mr.
Osborne’s brief career in prison may
have a certain justification, in so far as
the real prison life can be learned only
slowly; but, after all, the results of that
October week of Mr. Osborne’s, measured
by general results both upon himself
and upon the prison, have been perhaps
the greatest in the history of the
century-old prison.</p>

<p>Point Number Two in the development
of the new freedom occurred in the
basket shop, where Mr. Osborne was
given as a teacher and side-partner for
the week Jack Murphy, whom Mr. Osborne
describes as a very fine and sincere
man. From Murphy’s character
came unconsciously to Mr. Osborne the
suggestion that prisoners could be trusted
far more than had been the case at
Auburn. “Why couldn’t there be started
here,” asked Mr. Osborne, “a kind of
mutual improvement or mutual welfare
league among the prisoners, whereby, in
return for pledges of obedience and loyalty
to the prison administration, greater
freedom and more privileges might be
obtained?”</p>

<p>The third step toward the present
modified form of self-government occurred
after Mr. Osborne, having emerged
from his week’s imprisonment, gave
public expression to his indignation at
the alleged mediæval methods of treating
human beings behind the bars. These
published accounts, spread broadcast
over the country, are well remembered.
He set to work then to establish a league
among the prisoners. And from the beginning
he sought to have the League
evolve its principles and its pledges from
among the men themselves, not through
him or through officials of the prison.</p>

<p>The organization was simple. Any
prisoner could join the League. The
motto was: “Do good, make good.” Unquestionably
the incentive in the minds
of most inmates to join the League was
that there might be something in it for
them. When similar motives are eliminated
from the minds of men who undertake
enterprises on the outside of the
prison, it will be time to criticise unfavorably
such motives inside the walls.</p>

<p>From the League members—and at
present nearly every prisoner in Auburn
is a member, wearing his little green and
white button with “M. W. L.” thereon—a
board of delegates, forty-nine in number,
was elected by the prisoners themselves.
This is Point Number Four.
The prisoners did their own choosing of
their delegate officers. The officers were
not superimposed upon them by the prison
officials. And in consequence, if
these delegate officers did not act on the
level; if they became stool-pigeons, bearing
all sorts of tales to the prison officials
and currying favor thereby, then the prison
administration would not be to blame
for the choice of inmate officers. It
would be squarely up to the inmates
themselves. What was the result? A
very simple one. Both the companies of
inmates and their officers instinctively
aimed to adjust themselves to secure the
minimum of trouble, at chapel, in the
shops, at recreation. Splendid group
psychology, and withal so simple. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
incidentally it can be said that the inmates
have been able to handle most dexterously
not a few “tough guys” who had
been giving great trouble to the prison
administration.</p>

<p>At this stage the movement became
bigger than any one man, even Mr. Osborne.
The latter had imprisoned himself,
he had suggested the formation of
the League; he had organized the League;
but now it was up to the inmates to
make of the League a success.</p>

<p>The fifth stage in the development of
the League came suddenly and through
necessity. Early in June an epidemic of
scarlatina struck the prison. Ultimately,
about a thousand prisoners were infected.
Few were in the hospital, but shop
work slackened up to a considerable degree.
Were the prisoners in consequence
to be locked day after day in their cells?
Was it longer necessary? The answer
came one afternoon when Warden Rattigan
took a long chance. He turned all
the prisoners belonging to the League out
to exercise or play according to their
hearts’ content in the big yard, principally
under the supervision of the delegates,
who until now had been used to
move the prisoners to chapel and to entertainments.
It was a crucial test. It
worked perfectly. Order was maintained,
and no efforts to escape were made.</p>

<p>“The boys would tear a fellow to
pieces that tried it,” one of the prisoners
explained to me. “We’ve pledged ourselves
to behave. Besides, do you think
we want to lose the privileges we’ve
gained?”</p>

<p>By the Fourth of July the daily recreation
period, from four o’clock on, had
been going for about a month. What
have been the results?</p>

<p>“Everything,” answered one of the
delegates. “Take my own case. Now I
can sleep nights in that small hole in the
wall called a cell. I have been here for
years, and hardly ever had I had a decent
night’s sleep. Now I get tired in the
recreation hour. And then, too, we have
something to look forward to. It’s a
fearful mistake to make prison life so
hopeless. You can’t get the best out of
a man, in work or anything else, if you
don’t give him something to work for.
Now, if we behave ourselves and are
decent members of the League, we have
a decent amount of freedom and privileges.
We have competitive games in
baseball, bowling, and the like. We feel
we amount to something. The boys
march now with their heads up. We eat
better. The food tastes better. A lot of
the sullen resentment and hatred of the
prison administration is gone. The work
in the shops is better. There’s better
discipline.”</p>

<p>“What about dope?” we asked. “They
say it’s a curse at Sing Sing.”</p>

<p>“Very little here now,” said several
delegates at once. “It isn’t needed now,
and it’s frowned upon.” Then up spoke
one of the huskiest and best proportioned
of the Executive Committee of the League.
“I’ll be frank,” he said, emphatically.
“I’ve taken pretty nearly every
kind of dope that’s known. I took it deliberately.
Now I don’t need it, and I’ve
cut it out.”</p>

<p>“Let me say something else, too,” said
another delegate. “There’s mighty little
prison vice here now. You know
what I mean. Formerly, when we were
all locked up for sixteen hours a day,
and hadn’t had any decent exercise, or
anything to take our minds off of ourselves
and our grievances, all sorts of
bad things happened. That’s the curse
of the old prison regime. It turned out,
among other things, a lot of degenerates.
Now—well, we get pretty well tired, and
our mind’s taken off of ourselves, and
we sleep. There’s a good deal, too, in
having that sort of thing put under the
ban by the fellows themselves.”</p>

<p>One of us then asked, “How about the
growing criticism that prisoners are getting
to have too easy a time of it? When
we tell the public in general about this
Fourth of July celebration, many will
say that the prisoners are having more
fun and an easier time than the honest
taxpayer.”</p>

<p>The delegate, in answering, flared up.
“Tell those people to try any prison for
a while! What’s a prison for? To torture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
a man, and send him out hating society,
and determined to get even for the
years he’s spent as the old-line prison
made him spend it? Nobody except the
fellow that’s been through it knows what
being in prison is. Does the public want
us to go insane, get tuberculosis, contract
wretched vices, rebel in mutinies,
live sixteen hours out of twenty-four in
a living tomb, and have day-in and day-out
a miserable monotony of existence
that dulls our minds and makes us hate
the State that munificently pays us a cent
and a half a day, and then often takes
away the earnings of months in one single
fine for some offense that the very
manner of existence here almost forces
us to commit? Why, what is this hour
of recreation, anyway? It’s a health
measure, a safety measure, a reformatory
measure.</p>

<p>“Do you think fellows would commit
crime in order to get into prison to have
this little pittance of pleasure? Let me
tell you that the very people that talk so
about putting the clamps on this giving
of soft snaps to prisoners don’t know
what that other system did to us. Why,
there are a lot of fellows here that had
made up their minds to pull off another
trick just as soon as they got out. Why
shouldn’t they? But now we have something
else to work for.”</p>

<p>Much of the above conversation occurred
at a meeting of the Executive
Committee of the League, to which we
were invited. It was essentially a novel
experience. Here sat, in the warden’s
office, and without the warden or any
prison official present, a round dozen of
convicts, gray-suited and thoroughly in
earnest. They discussed prison conditions
and prison problems with all the
freedom of a board of managers, and
with far greater knowledge of actual
conditions. Prisoners know more about
a prison than does the warden, the warden
than does the superintendent of prisons,
the superintendent of prisons than
do the inspectors, and the inspectors
than does the public. Therefore, if the
best efforts and the best loyalty of the
prisoners can be harnessed up to a reformatory
programme of the square deal
for both sides, the possibilities of the future
loom far larger than have reformatory
possibilities in the past.</p>

<p>So Auburn Prison is pointing the way,
by an almost revolutionary experiment,
to large possibilities in inmate self-government
in State prisons and reformatories.
As I write these lines the newspapers
bring a word of a similar Saturday
afternoon passed in sports for the
first time in the history of Sing Sing.
Within the last week the State Reformatory
of New Jersey, at Rahway, has
adopted tentatively a modified form of
inmate self-government. Great Meadow
Prison, in New York State, which has
been for several years the conspicuous
honor prison of the eastern part of the
country, marched its six hundred men
down to the baseball game on July
Fourth, a half-mile from the prison, under
inmate overseers.</p>

<p>Self-government, to the limit of its
possibilities, is almost a fetish with Mr.
Osborne. For many years he was President
of the Board of Trustees of the
George Junior Republic; there he became
convinced that self-government is
workable not only for youngsters but for
older delinquents.</p>

<p>In the old-line prison the ever-present
dread of the traditional warden was an
escape. His career was judged largely
by his ability to suppress escapes and
frequently by his ability to suppress public
knowledge of the methods he used
to keep order. Today the warden is
judged able or poor partly by his ability
to develop men out of his prisoners,
men who on going out will make good.
The entire theory of the old-line prison
construction was based on the principle
that any prisoner would escape if
he could, and use desperate means of so
doing. The bars and steel-work that
you see everywhere in prisons throughout
the country show how ingrained the
theory has been. But up at Great Meadow,
where the bulk of the prisoners
roam unattended by guards at their work
during the day, it is almost ridiculous
to see them securely caged behind several
strata of tool-proof steel at night.</p>

<p>In the last few years demonstrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
in scores of prisons and other correctional
institutions have shown that, if given
the chance, when on honor, the prisoners
won’t run away. The old adage of
“honor among thieves” has taken on an
entirely new meaning. It is now “honor
among thieves toward the State that
trusts them.”</p>

<p>The power of discipline in the League
is very limited. The only punishment is
suspension or elimination from the League.
Such action is delegated to the
Executive Committee of the League.
Actually, this exclusion from the body
politic—since almost every prisoner is a
member of the League—carries with it
two important disadvantages. It stamps
the excluded inmates as <i>anti-social, not
only to the prison administration, but to
the body of prisoners</i>. Secondly, it bars
the prisoner from enjoying the freedom
privileges that the League enjoys.
Therefore the power of suspension, be
it for but a few days, has real force.
The powers of discipline given to the
League by the warden have not been accurately
fixed as yet. The warden has
told the League that all minor cases of
discipline could be punished by them;
wisely, I think, the officers of the League
have not been desirous of punishing.</p>

<p>So that at present men are turned back
to the prison authorities by the League
for violation of the League discipline.
The theory is that these men will be put
back under the old discipline of silence
and confinement, because they are no
longer members of the League. The
main body of the prisoners have then no
official interest in them, so that the suspension
involves practically a return to
the old prison routine.</p>

<p>Recently a new Board of Delegates has
been elected, and one of their first acts
was to adopt a probation system instead
of the definite sentence, in the cases of
offenders against the League. A committee
of parole has been established,
which shall visit the suspended men at
least once a week, and as soon as the
committee thinks that the state of mind of
the suspended men warrants the action
the Parole Committee recommends to
the Executive Committee the restoration
of the men to the full privileges of the
League.</p>

<p>“A big test is coming,” said one delegate,
“when the members of the League
go out. It will be up to them to justify
by their conduct after prison the principles
they accepted here and the privileges
they received.” And the story was
told us of one young man who was the
first of the delegates to receive his release
from prison. He is said to have
made a hard fight to stay straight, mainly
because he didn’t want to “put the League
in bad” by having one of its officers
go crooked.</p>

<p>And here opens up still another far-reaching
possibility. Why should not
the members of the League, once released
from prison, form committees in the
various cities and communities of the
State for the purpose of helping the still
later ones who come out of Auburn to
make good? Heretofore the best that
we of the Prison Association of New
York have achieved has been to employ
big-hearted and sympathetic parole officers—real
friends of the released inmates.
And we have scored good success.
But it has been always a case of
supervision and encouragement by the
officer.</p>

<p>And so this was the proposition which
we members of the Board of Managers
of the Prison Association made to the
Executive Committee of the League:
“Will you co-operate with us in helping
released prisoners from Auburn make
their parole satisfactorily? Will you
have small groups of ex-League members
ready in various parts of the State
to work with our county committees to
the one end of tiding and helping the discharged
and released prisoner over the
hard months that immediately follow his
release?”</p>

<p>With enthusiasm the suggestion has
been accepted. One delegate spoke up:
“I’m going out next month. I don’t
know where I’ll get work, but I’m willing
to go anywhere the League sends
me. I’m willing and eager to give my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
life to this work, if I’m wanted!”</p>

<p>Such, briefly, is a picture of the Mutual
Welfare League. That it is significant
in its possibilities no one can doubt.
What its outcome will be a year from
now it would be hazardous to forecast.
It may be but a burst ahead of the general
humanitarian movement that characterizes
prison reform throughout the
country. It may be that when the altruistic
enthusiasm that now holds the
more thoughtful members of the League
wanes, as wane it will to some extent,
there will come a slump, and an arrogance
of demand for more privileges
that will give to the reactionary among
prison administrators a chance to say,
“I told you so!”</p>

<p>But I much doubt it. The greater
danger will come from possible stupidity
of prison administration, a change
perhaps of authority at the prison, and
a consequent lack of sympathy with the
purpose of the League.</p>

<p>One thing seems sure. Prisons and
reformatories will not go back to the
old-line repressive and often brutal treatment.
The transition to what will ultimately
become the new treatment of delinquents
is being attended by various
experiments, often startling and sometimes
amazing. We are not a Nation
that thinks for a long time before acting
in prison reform. Our successes have
come so far largely from experimenting,
retaining the successes and scrapping
the failures. How much of the honor
system, the back-to-the-land movement,
the road-work movement, and the increasing
classification of prisoners will
be scrapped, it is much too early as yet
to say.</p>

<p>The final test will probably be along
two lines. We shall determine how the
“new freedom” works within prison
walls, applying the acid tests of health,
increased efficiency in labor, reformative
value, education, and general training
for a decent life in society. We shall
also have to show, if we are friends of
the “new freedom,” that such treatment
within the prison produces a larger number
of permanent reformations after
prison, a higher percentage of those who
make good.</p>

<p>In short, the ultimate test is going to
be not the increased possibility afforded
the prisoner of enduring his prison term,
nor yet the increased ease of administration
of correctional institutions, but
fairly and squarely as to whether society,
from which all these prisoners come, and
which has been the sufferer by them, is
to be permanently better protected from
their further depredations by giving
them what today seems to be a square
deal within the prisons, and a decent
chance to make good after they come
out.</p>

Iowa, the convicts have had a “raise” in
wages, as a result of their first week’s
showing. They were receiving twenty
cents an hour; now they get twenty-five.
They have been working for the Iowa
State College, first doing “odd jobs”
around the institution, then oiling and
cutting roads. “Adams, the guard with
the men, is virtually losing his job as
guard and becoming merely time-keeper
for the bunch.” ... There are now

<p><i>Important Resignations Announced</i>—A
number of important changes are taking
place in executive positions in well-known
prisons and reformatories. Warden
Wolfer is shortly to leave the Minnesota
State Prison. Warden Bridges
has resigned from his long service at the
Massachusetts State Prison, Warden
Brown has been succeeded in West Virginia
by State Senator M. Z. White.
Chairman Frank L. Randall of the Massachusetts
Prison Commission is said to
be resigning on September 1st, Superintendent
Reid of the Minnesota State Reformatory
is to take Warden Wolfer’s
place, and Henry K. W. Scott, formerly
warden of the New Hampshire State
Prison, is to go to the position left vacant
by Superintendent Reid.</p>

<p>Henry Wolfer has been in prison work
43 years. He began, says the Minneapolis
Tribune, in a day when filth, vermin,
brutality and torture were prominent
features of prison life. He ends it as
warden of a prison declared by many
authorities to be one of the finest in the
world. Warden Wolfer began as guard
at Joliet Prison as a boy of 18. A recent
number of the Delinquent (&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;)
contained an article about the Warden’s
remarkable work as an administrator
and as a business man.</p>

<p>Warden Bridges has been 21 years at
the Massachusetts State Prison. The
Boston Herald says that when he took
hold, conditions were chaotic. The Warden
has made a specialty of inmate education.
The correspondence courses,
run entirely within the prison, are noteworthy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
The prison paper, the Mentor,
is written entirely by hand, and facsimiled.
The prison is a congregate, old,
cramped structure. Recently, sports
have been developed in the limited prison
yard.</p>

<p>Warden Brown of the West Virginia
Penitentiary seems to be making a place
for another appointee. The Wheeling,
W. Va., Intelligencer, says that the prison
is losing the best and ablest executive
it ever had. He had in three and a
half years renovated the sanitary system,
improved discipline, abolished corporal
punishment, elevated the standard of the
prison school, turned over to the State
(by contract labor) $120,000 above expenses,
instituted a prison savings bank,
with $35,000 in prisoners’ earnings for
the overtime work, and has developed a
prisoners’ aid society for helping the
families of convicts. He has also developed
two camps.</p>

<p>Whether Chairman Randall of the
Massachusetts Prison Commission is to
leave Massachusetts is at the time of
writing unsettled. Rumor has it that he
has been seriously disappointed at the
practically absolute failure of his extensive
prison reform program to pass the
Legislature, and also at the failure of
the Legislature to appropriate an increase
in salary which he was given to
understand would occur this year, in
view of the fact that he left Minnesota
last year at considerable financial sacrifice.
There is no question that Massachusetts
will be a serious loser, if Mr. Randall
goes. There seems also a certain
amount of hostility toward an “imported”
penologist. This is a sad attitude
of mind, but not confined solely to Massachusetts.</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Extension Courses of California University
in Folsom Prison.</i>—The report
of the university extension director, in
charge of the work at Folsom Prison, is
interesting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We began in January, and the official enrollment
is now 324 students. As I soon found
that many of the men had brains no better
developed than those of a child of 8 years,
classes were formed in elementary English,
German and arithmetic.</p>

<p>“The teaching is done by convicts who have
proved themselves fitted for the positions, 15
being on the staff. Aside from financial reasons,
this was done because the prisoners need
teachers who are in sympathy with them.</p>

<p>“All are not permitted to take the school
work; some because of conduct, others because
they are unable to keep up to the required
standard; still others do not wish to
take it. Any man who is unprepared twice in
succession is dropped from the class. Many
failed on this account when the work was
first began as they were using it merely as an
excuse to get out of their prison duties.</p>

<p>“A man often wants to follow a profession
or trade to which he is unsuited. Whenever
one comes to me asking help in learning a
trade, I find out what trade or profession he
is best suited for.”</p>

<p>When asked if the convicts appreciated the
work, Mr. Jacobs’ face lighted up. “They do
now,” he said. “My hand is still sore from
the greetings they gave me when I returned
from a trip East, but they tried all sorts of
tricks to get men when the work was first
started.”</p>

<p><i>Funds for Deserted Wives.</i>—According
to the Pittsburg Times, Pennsylvania’s
law which went into effect a year
ago, providing payment to wives of men
committed to the workhouse for non-support
and desertion during the time
the husband is serving his sentence, is
proving a wonderful aid to women of
Allegheny county, as proved by a record
of the first year’s results. About $5,200
has been paid to 107 women since July,
1913, when the law went into effect, the
average having been $12.50 for each woman.</p>

<p>Lawrence M. Fagan, probation officer
in Allegheny county, through whose
hands these funds went, is enthusiastic.
“It’s been an excellent thing,” he said,
“an arrangement which has solved a problem
that has confronted probation officers
ever since the first man was sent to
prison for non-support. Previously the
wives were no better off while a man was
in jail than they had been before and often
were much worse off. They had nothing
at all coming in in most cases. Seldom
did they receive more than their
earnings which in no case were large.”</p>

<p>These women now can expect help
each month. Every man is credited 65
cents a day for every day he works and
the money is given his wife. This has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
amounted to $17.45 a month in some cases,
although often it has only been a
few dollars, but in every case it has been
received with great welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. Fagan explained that men are sent
to the workhouse only as a last resort.
They are generally given a chance to
support their families after being arrested
for the first time and then if they
fail they are committed to prison. The
payments have averaged $400 from this
source alone.</p>

<p>The general funds that pass through
the hands of the probation officer from
husbands who are supporting their families
on order of the court, with the probation
office as an intermediary, and
from the workhouse to wives, reached
$55,500 during the past six months.
During June alone the total was $10,600.</p>

<p>An autobus has been installed to carry
prisoners from New York City to Sing
Sing prison. This will do away with the
necessity of marching prisoners from
the station at Ossining to the prison, a
distance of about half mile. The prison
is thirty miles from New York.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A hospital for tubercular convicts is
to be established at the Maryland State
Penitentiary, an appropriation of $35,000
having been made by the legislature.
A prison school is also having excellent
success.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Prison contracts are to be continued
“indefinitely” in the New Jersey State
prison, according to the Bayonne, N. J.,
Review of July 2d, because there are not
sufficient funds for the installation of
the State-use system. About 1,500 convicts
are employed at the prison. Were
the contracts permitted to lapse, the prisoners
would be idle.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The county commissioners of Beaufort
county, N. C., have voted that convicts
on the county roads may be whipped.
“The superintendent shall keep in
his possession a lash 18 inches long, attached
to a stick 18 inches long and not
more than two inches in diameter, and
said lash may split three times half-way
from the end,” according to the resolution.
No convict may be whipped more
than once during two consecutive days,
shall not receive more than 25 lashes at
one whipping, and must not be beaten on
the neck or head. (We append these details,
because relics of barbarism should
also be recorded in the Delinquent. Ed).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Out of a total of 1,478 prisoners confined
in the Eastern Penitentiary of
Pennsylvania 1,008 have signed a petition
which will be submitted to the next
legislature asking Statewide prohibition.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The old State prison at Stillwater,
Minn, was practically abandoned on
July 31st, when the last shoe contract
expired. Hereafter all work at the Stillwater
(new) prison will be done for the
State.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>During July some riots of considerable
seriousness occurred on Blackwell’s
Island, New York City. Indictments
for assault in the second degree have
now been returned against the five ringleaders
in the riots at the Penitentiary
on July 8th. A maximum sentence of
five years is attached to conviction.</p>
